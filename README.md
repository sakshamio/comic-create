# Multimodal Computer Vision and NLP Project: Creating Unlimited Graphic Novels from a Single Prompt

This is a GitHub repository for a multimodal computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) project that aims to generate unlimited graphic novels from a single prompt. The project uses multiple openAI APIs like the ChatGPT API, the Dall-E 2 API, and Vercel edge functions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an AI-powered system that can generate graphic novels from a single prompt. The system uses a combination of computer vision and NLP techniques to analyze the prompt and generate a story with corresponding images. The system is powered by multiple openAI APIs, including the ChatGPT API, which provides the NLP capabilities, and the Dall-E 2 API, which provides the image generation capabilities. Vercel edge functions are used to connect these APIs and create a seamless experience for the user.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have the following:

A valid API key for the openAI ChatGPT API and Dall-E 2 API
Node.js (version 14 or later)
NPM (version 6 or later)

## Usage

Start the server and the system will be available at http://localhost:3000.

To generate a graphic novel, enter a prompt in the input field and click the "Generate" button. The system will then use the openAI ChatGPT API to generate a story and the Dall-E 2 API to generate corresponding images. The resulting graphic novel will be displayed on the screen.
